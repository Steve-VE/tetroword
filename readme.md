## About the project

**[Tetroword](https://github.com/Steve-VE/tetroword)** is a videogame project with a simple concept: a Tetris-like game with a word play phase !


## How to play
Like in any Tetris games, you have to arrange pieces of four tiles to make lines.
Once a line is complete, the line dissapear and you get points, but there is a twist !
Every piece contains four letters, and when a line is erased, you have to use those letters to write words in a short time.
Each word grants you points. More the word is longer, more you get points !
If you achieve to use all the letters, you get extra bonus points, but if you let a lot of unused letters when the time is over, the piece will drop a little bit faster.

### Key bindings
- Move to left: Left arrow
- Move to right: Right arrow
- Hard drop (makes the piece immediately downs to the ground): Up arrow
- Soft drop (makes the piece downs space by space): Down arrow
- Rotation to the left: Spacebar
- Rotation to the right: E key
- Toggle the pause: Tab key

The key bindings is configurable in the settings, so feel free to reconfigure them like you want !
